# What's The Dish (WTD) Frontend Workflows

This doc presents complete, straightforward, step-by-step, easy-to-follow workflows for developing and deploying the WTD web app.

## Local Development

This web app was bootstrapped from [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev). The development workflow is super simple as you might guess:

- Make code changes
- Save and wait for watch mode to automatically refresh the app
- Checkout to a new branch, commit, and push to remote
- Create a pull request to `master`
- Review the changes and then merge the pull request

## Production Deployment

### On the local machine

TBD.

### On the cloud server

TBD.
